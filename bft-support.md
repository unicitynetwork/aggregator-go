# BFT Support for Unicity Aggregator

## Overview

The Unicity Aggregator supports Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) through integration with the BFT core. This enables the aggregator to participate in a distributed consensus network where nodes can continue to operate correctly even if some nodes fail or act maliciously.

## Requirements for BFT Support

### Prerequisites

1. **BFT Core**: The BFT functionality depends on the BFT core library
2. **Go Dependencies**: Ensure all BFT-related dependencies are available:
   ```
   github.com/unicitynetwork/bft-core
   ```

### Configuration Files

For BFT support, you need to provide BFT-specific configuration files generated by the BFT core:

#### Required Configuration Files

1. **Shard Configuration** (`bft-config/shard-conf-7_0.json`)
   - Generated using BFT core for aggregator node (a custom BFT partition)
   - Contains network topology and node information
   - Defines the shard structure and participant nodes

2. **Keys Configuration** (`bft-config/keys.json`)
   - Contains cryptographic keys for the aggregator node
   - Includes public/private key pairs for consensus participation
   - Must be kept secure and not shared publicly

3. **Trust Base Configuration** (`bft-config/trust-base.json`)
   - Defines the initial trust relationships in the network
   - Contains root certificates or trusted node identities
   - Used for initial network bootstrap and validation

### Configuration File Generation

Use the BFT core tools to generate the required configuration files:

# Generate aggregator node info and keys
`build/ubft shard-node init --home "test-nodes/aggregator" --generate`
# Generate shard configuration for aggregator
`build/ubft shard-conf generate --home test-nodes \
                  --network-id 3 \
                  --partition-id 7 \
                  --partition-type-id 7 \
                  --epoch-start 10 \
                  --node-info test-nodes/aggregator/node-info.json`
                  
# Copy shard configuration for aggregator node
`cp <bftcore location>/test-nodes/shard-conf-7_0.json bft-config/shard-conf-7_0.json`
# Copy keys configuration
`cp <bftcore location>/test-nodes/aggregator/keys.json bft-config/keys.json`
# Copy trust base configuration  
`cp <bftcore location>/test-nodes/trust-base.json bft-config/trust-base.json`


### Environment Variable Overrides

The aggregator automatically picks up configuration files from the default locations. You can override these paths using environment variables:

- `BFT_KEY_CONF_FILE`: Override path to keys.json
- `BFT_SHARD_CONF_FILE`: Override path to shard configuration file
- `BFT_TRUST_BASE_FILE`: Override path to trust-base.json

Example:
```bash
export BFT_KEY_CONF_FILE=/custom/path/keys.json
export BFT_SHARD_CONF_FILE=/custom/path/shard-conf.json
export BFT_TRUST_BASE_FILE=/custom/path/trust-base.json
```

### Building with BFT Support

To build the aggregator with BFT support, ensure all dependencies are available:

```bash
go mod tidy
go build ./cmd/aggregator
```

**Note**: BFT functionality is currently optional. The aggregator can run without BFT dependencies for development and testing purposes.
