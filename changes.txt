CHANGELOG ENTRY - 09 January 2025 at 15:30 CET

## Foundation Implementation Complete

### What was implemented:
- **Complete Go project structure** with standard layout (cmd/, internal/, pkg/)
- **Configuration management** via environment variables with validation and defaults
- **Core data models** with proper JSON serialization for BigInt, HexBytes, Timestamp types
- **MongoDB storage layer** with interface-based abstraction and complete implementations
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 server** with middleware support, concurrency limiting, and error handling
- **HTTP gateway server** using Gin with health endpoints and API documentation
- **Business logic service** implementing all aggregator methods (submit_commitment, get_inclusion_proof, etc.)
- **High availability infrastructure** with MongoDB-based leader election (ready for activation)
- **Comprehensive documentation** including README.md with API examples and configuration

### Technical details:
- Built with Go 1.24, Gin web framework, MongoDB driver, and Logrus logging
- Implements all JSON-RPC methods from TypeScript version with API compatibility
- MongoDB collections with proper indexing: commitments, aggregator_records, blocks, smt_nodes, block_records, leadership
- Environment-based configuration supporting all TypeScript variables plus Go-specific optimizations
- Graceful shutdown, TLS support, CORS headers, and health monitoring
- Request correlation with UUIDs, structured logging, and comprehensive error codes

### Current status:
- âœ… Foundation and core infrastructure complete
- âœ… JSON-RPC API server fully functional
- âœ… MongoDB integration with indexing
- âœ… Documentation and configuration complete
- ðŸš§ SMT integration pending (returns mock inclusion proofs)
- ðŸš§ Round management pending (no automated block creation)
- ðŸš§ Consensus integration pending (Alphabill submission)

### Next implementation phases:
1. Sparse Merkle Tree implementation for real inclusion proofs
2. Round manager for automated block creation every second
3. Consensus integration with external blockchain
4. Performance optimization and load testing
5. Comprehensive test suite

### Build and deployment:
- Service builds successfully with `make build`
- Runs on configurable port (default 3000) with health endpoint at /health
- Ready for testing with MongoDB backend
- All configuration via environment variables for containerization

This completes the foundational phase of the Go rewrite, providing a solid, scalable base for the remaining aggregator functionality while maintaining full API compatibility with the TypeScript implementation.
