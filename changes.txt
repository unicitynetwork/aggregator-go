CHANGELOG ENTRY - 09 June 2025 at 15:30 CET

## Foundation Implementation Complete

### What was implemented:
- **Complete Go project structure** with standard layout (cmd/, internal/, pkg/)
- **Configuration management** via environment variables with validation and defaults
- **Core data models** with proper JSON serialization for BigInt, HexBytes, Timestamp types
- **MongoDB storage layer** with interface-based abstraction and complete implementations
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 server** with middleware support, concurrency limiting, and error handling
- **HTTP gateway server** using Gin with health endpoints and API documentation
- **Business logic service** implementing all aggregator methods (submit_commitment, get_inclusion_proof, etc.)
- **High availability infrastructure** with MongoDB-based leader election (ready for activation)
- **Comprehensive documentation** including README.md with API examples and configuration

### Technical details:
- Built with Go 1.24, Gin web framework, MongoDB driver, and Logrus logging
- Implements all JSON-RPC methods from TypeScript version with API compatibility
- MongoDB collections with proper indexing: commitments, aggregator_records, blocks, smt_nodes, block_records, leadership
- Environment-based configuration supporting all TypeScript variables plus Go-specific optimizations
- Graceful shutdown, TLS support, CORS headers, and health monitoring
- Request correlation with UUIDs, structured logging, and comprehensive error codes

### Current status:
- âœ… Foundation and core infrastructure complete
- âœ… JSON-RPC API server fully functional
- âœ… MongoDB integration with indexing
- âœ… Documentation and configuration complete
- ðŸš§ SMT integration pending (returns mock inclusion proofs)
- ðŸš§ Round management pending (no automated block creation)
- ðŸš§ Consensus integration pending (Alphabill submission)

### Next implementation phases:
1. Sparse Merkle Tree implementation for real inclusion proofs
2. Round manager for automated block creation every second
3. Consensus integration with external blockchain
4. Performance optimization and load testing
5. Comprehensive test suite

### Build and deployment:
- Service builds successfully with `make build`
- Runs on configurable port (default 3000) with health endpoint at /health
- Ready for testing with MongoDB backend
- All configuration via environment variables for containerization

This completes the foundational phase of the Go rewrite, providing a solid, scalable base for the remaining aggregator functionality while maintaining full API compatibility with the TypeScript implementation.

## Go Version Update

### What was changed:
- **Updated Go version** from 1.22 to 1.24 in go.mod
- **Updated README.md** to reflect Go 1.24 requirement in prerequisites

### Technical details:
- Changed go.mod to specify `go 1.24`
- Updated documentation to require Go 1.24 or later
- Verified build compatibility with `make build`
- All dependencies remain compatible with Go 1.24

### Verification:
- Build successful with Go 1.24
- No breaking changes in dependencies
- Service maintains full functionality

## Docker Compose and Containerization

### What was implemented:
- **Docker Compose configuration** with MongoDB and Aggregator services
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** for optimized Go binary builds
- **MongoDB initialization script** with database setup and indexing
- **Docker development workflow** integrated into Makefile
- **Updated documentation** with Docker quick start guide

### Technical details:
- **docker-compose.yml**: MongoDB on localhost:27017, Aggregator on localhost:3333
- **MongoDB setup**: mongo:7.0 image with admin credentials (admin/password)
- **Database initialization**: Automated collection creation and index setup via mongo-init.js
- **Aggregator container**: Alpine-based with non-root user, health checks, and proper dependencies
- **Networking**: Bridge network for inter-service communication
- **Volumes**: Persistent MongoDB data storage
- **Health checks**: Both services include health monitoring

### Docker services configuration:
- **MongoDB**: 
  - Port mapping: 27017:27017
  - Credentials: admin/password
  - Database: aggregator (auto-created)
  - Health check: mongosh ping command
- **Aggregator**: 
  - Port mapping: 3333:3000
  - Environment: Full configuration for production use
  - Dependencies: Waits for MongoDB health check
  - Health check: wget to /health endpoint

### Makefile additions:
- `make docker-build`: Build Docker image
- `make docker-up`: Start services
- `make docker-down`: Stop services  
- `make docker-logs`: View logs
- `make docker-restart`: Restart services
- `make docker-rebuild`: Rebuild and restart
- `make docker-clean`: Clean up resources

### Files created:
- `docker-compose.yml`: Service orchestration
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage Go build
- `scripts/mongo-init.js`: Database initialization
- `.dockerignore`: Build optimization

### Documentation updates:
- Added "Quick Start with Docker" section
- Updated development workflow with Docker commands
- Documented service endpoints and credentials

### Ready for use:
- Run `make docker-up` to start both services
- MongoDB accessible at localhost:27017
- Aggregator accessible at localhost:3333
- Full API functionality with persistent database
