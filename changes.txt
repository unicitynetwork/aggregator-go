- **proposeBlock**: Details block creation, root hash, and BFT client interaction
- **FinalizeBlock**: Confirms successful block storage and round completion
- **BFT client**: CertificationRequest and handleUnicityCertificate methods
- **Fixed syntax error** in BFT client's conditional logging

### Discovery:
These logs revealed that the round manager stopped producing blocks when the root chain
timed out waiting for a certification request and sent a "repeat UC" with an incremented
round number that the aggregator wasn't expecting.

---

CHANGELOG ENTRY - 5 January 2025 at 15:10 CET

## BFT Client Root Chain Timeout Handling

### What was fixed:
- **BFT client now handles root chain timeout scenarios** preventing service from getting stuck
- **Automatic round skipping** when root chain moves ahead due to aggregator delays
- **Graceful recovery** from mismatched UC rounds

### Technical details:
- **Root chain timeout**: Has 2.5-second timeout for certification requests
- **Problem scenario**: When aggregator takes >2.5s to process round, root chain sends "repeat UC" and increments expected round
- **Solution**: Detect UC round mismatches and skip to root chain's expected round

### Implementation changes:
- **handleUnicityCertificate**: Added logic to detect UC round vs proposed block mismatch
- **Skip ahead logic**: Clear stale proposed blocks and jump to next round when behind
- **Stale UC handling**: Ignore outdated UCs for rounds already passed
- **Round skipping detection**: Log warnings when skipping rounds in StartNewRound

### Monitoring improvements:
- Warning logs when UC round doesn't match proposed block
- Info logs when skipping rounds to catch up with root chain
- Detection and logging of skipped rounds in round manager

This fix ensures the aggregator can recover when heavy load causes processing delays,
preventing the service from permanently stalling when the root chain times out.

CHANGELOG ENTRY - 5 January 2025 at 15:25 CET

## Critical Fix: Deferred Commitment Finalization

### What was fixed:
- **Commitments are no longer lost when rounds are skipped** due to root chain timeouts
- **Deferred finalization** ensures commitments only marked as processed after block is stored
- **Aggregator records** stored with correct block numbers after finalization

### Problem discovered:
- Commitments were marked as processed BEFORE knowing if block would be accepted
- If root chain rejected/skipped a round, commitments were lost (marked processed but not in any block)
- Aggregator records were stored immediately, potentially with wrong block numbers

### Solution implemented:
1. **Deferred marking**: Commitments stay unprocessed until block is finalized with UC
2. **Pending state tracking**: Round tracks pending records and root hash until finalization
3. **Correct block assignment**: Aggregator records get actual finalized block number
4. **Atomic finalization**: Both commitment marking and record storage happen after block storage

### Implementation changes:
- **Round struct**: Added PendingRecords and PendingRootHash fields
- **processCurrentRound**: Removed early MarkProcessed call, stores pending data
- **processBatch**: No longer stores aggregator records immediately
- **FinalizeBlock**: Now handles both commitment marking and record storage atomically

### Benefits:
- No commitment loss even if rounds are skipped
- Commitments remain in unprocessed queue if round fails
- Next successful round will include previously attempted commitments
- Aggregator records always have correct block numbers
- SMT remains consistent even with round skipping

This ensures data integrity when the aggregator faces heavy load and root chain timeouts,
preventing any submitted commitments from being lost in the system.

CHANGELOG ENTRY - 5 January 2025 at 15:20 CET

## Sequential Round Processing Fix

### What was fixed:
- **Eliminated concurrent round processing** that caused race conditions
- **Block numbers now automatically adjust** to match root chain expectations
- **Performance test enhanced** to detect unprocessed commitments

### Problem discovered:
- UC responses could arrive while a round was still processing
- This caused the BFT client to start new rounds prematurely
- Rounds were being skipped, leaving commitments unprocessed
- Block numbers were getting out of sync with root chain

### Solution implemented:
1. **Sequential processing enforced**: UC handlers no longer start new rounds immediately
2. **Block number adjustment**: CertificationRequest adjusts block number to match root chain
3. **Atomic round transitions**: Only one round processes at a time
4. **Enhanced performance test**: Now alerts when commitments remain unprocessed

### Implementation changes:
- **BFT client**: Added nextExpectedRound tracking
- **UC handling**: Deferred round transitions when processing is in progress
- **CertificationRequest**: Automatically adjusts block numbers to root chain expectations
- **Performance test**: Added warnings and detailed error reporting for pending commitments

### Performance improvements:
- Reduced batch limit from 10,000 to 1,000 for sub-second processing
- Eliminated 15+ second processing delays that caused timeouts
- Stable throughput of ~300 commitments per block
- Consistent 1 block/second production rate

### Benefits:
- No more lost commitments due to round skipping
- Automatic synchronization with root chain expectations
- Clear visibility when processing pipeline has issues
- Reliable sequential processing without race conditions

This ensures the aggregator maintains perfect synchronization with the root chain
even under heavy load, with clear diagnostics when issues occur.

CHANGELOG ENTRY - 5 January 2025 at 15:35 CET

## Performance Test Counting Logic Refinement

### What was fixed:
- **Performance test now only counts commitments submitted by current test run**
- **Accurate tracking** prevents counting commitments from previous test runs
- **Thread-safe request ID tracking** using sync.Map

### Problem discovered:
- Test was counting all commitments in blocks, including ones from previous runs
- This caused inflated counts showing more commitments than actually submitted
- Block 740 showed 1000 commitments when test only submitted 695 in that run

### Solution implemented:
1. **Request ID tracking**: Store successfully submitted request IDs in sync.Map
2. **Filtered counting**: Only count commitments whose request IDs match our submissions
3. **Detailed reporting**: Show both our commitments and total commitments in blocks
4. **Thread-safe operations**: Use sync.Map for concurrent request ID tracking

### Implementation changes:
- Added `submittedRequestIDs sync.Map` to Metrics struct
- Store request IDs on successful submission in commitmentWorker
- Filter commitments in blocks to only count ones we submitted
- Enhanced output to show "X our commitments (total in block: Y)"

### Benefits:
- Accurate performance metrics for current test run
- Clear visibility when blocks contain commitments from other sources
- No interference from previous test runs or concurrent aggregator usage
- Precise throughput measurements for benchmarking

This ensures the performance test provides accurate, isolated metrics for each test run,
essential for reliable performance benchmarking and regression testing.

CHANGELOG ENTRY - 5 January 2025 at 15:45 CET

## Asynchronous Logging Implementation

### What was implemented:
- **Asynchronous logging system** to prevent I/O blocking in business logic
- **Configurable buffer size** for tuning memory vs performance trade-offs
- **Batch processing** of log entries for efficient I/O operations
- **Graceful shutdown** ensures no log loss during service termination

### Why it was needed:
- Synchronous logging was using direct I/O operations (stdout, stderr, file writes)
- Debug logs inside loops (e.g., processing 1000 commitments) caused significant overhead
- I/O operations in hot paths could block business logic processing
- Performance degradation under high load due to logging bottlenecks

### Solution architecture:
1. **AsyncLogger wrapper**: Implements slog.Handler interface for seamless integration
2. **Channel-based buffering**: Non-blocking log submission with configurable buffer
3. **Background worker**: Dedicated goroutine processes logs in batches
4. **Periodic flushing**: 10ms timer ensures timely log delivery
5. **Fallback mechanism**: Reverts to sync logging if async system fails

### Implementation details:
- Created `internal/logger/async_logger.go` with AsyncLogger implementation
- Modified Logger creation to optionally wrap with async handler
- Added configuration options: LOG_ENABLE_ASYNC and LOG_ASYNC_BUFFER_SIZE
- Integrated graceful shutdown to flush pending logs
- Default: async logging enabled with 10,000 entry buffer

### Performance benefits:
- Non-blocking log operations in critical paths
- Batch I/O reduces system call overhead
- Eliminates logging bottlenecks during high-throughput operations
- Particularly beneficial for debug logging in loops

### Configuration:
- `LOG_ENABLE_ASYNC=true` (default): Enable async logging
- `LOG_ASYNC_BUFFER_SIZE=10000` (default): Buffer size for log entries
- Async logging can be disabled by setting LOG_ENABLE_ASYNC=false

This implementation ensures logging doesn't impact business logic performance while
maintaining reliable log delivery and preventing log loss during shutdown.

### Implementation details:
1. **BFT Client Enhancement** (`internal/bft/client.go`):
   - Modified `CertificationRequest` to always use `nextExpectedRound` when available
   - Added fallback logic for startup when no UC has been received yet
   - Improved logging showing block number adjustments with differences
   - Better handling of UC round mismatches with proper recovery

2. **Deferred Finalization** (already in `batch_processor.go`):
   - Commitments only marked processed after block storage
   - Aggregator records stored with correct finalized block numbers
   - Prevents commitment loss during round skipping

3. **Round Management** (existing in `round_manager.go`):
   - Proper round state tracking and transitions
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Graceful handling of skipped rounds

### Test Results:
- Performance test: 9900 commitments submitted
- **All 9900 commitments successfully processed** into blocks
- Zero UC round mismatch errors
- Stable 1 block/second creation rate
- ~990 RPS submission rate achieved

### Investigation findings:
- MongoDB queries confirm all commitments are processed
- All aggregator records have correct block numbers
- Block distribution: 11 blocks containing 9900 total commitments
- No missing commitments - discrepancies in test output were due to API timing

### Benefits:
- Automatic synchronization with root chain expectations
- No commitment loss even under heavy load
- Graceful recovery from timing mismatches
- Clear diagnostic logging for troubleshooting

The implementation successfully maintains perfect synchronization between the
aggregator and root chain, ensuring reliable commitment processing even when
facing the 2.5-second root chain timeout constraints.

CHANGELOG ENTRY - 5 July 2025 at 17:20 CET

## Enhanced Root Chain Synchronization Fixes

### What was improved:
- **More robust block number adjustment** in CertificationRequest to handle edge cases
- **Improved UC round mismatch handling** with better recovery logic
- **Enhanced logging** for debugging synchronization issues
- **Better handling of initial synchronization** before first UC received

### Technical improvements:
1. **CertificationRequest enhancements**:
   - Always uses expected round number from root chain when available
   - Falls back to inferring from last UC when nextExpectedRound not yet set
   - Clear logging of adjustments with difference calculations
   - Handles case where aggregator hasn't received first UC yet

2. **UC mismatch handling improvements**:
   - Fixed logic for "root chain behind" scenario (was backwards)
   - Now properly clears proposed block and starts new round to resync
   - Better detection of stale UCs vs timing issues
   - Prevents getting stuck when root chain advances

3. **Enhanced logging**:
   - Warns when adjusting block numbers with difference shown
   - Info logs when no proposed block exists to finalize
   - Better context for debugging sync issues
   - Clear indication of why rounds are being skipped

### Problem scenarios addressed:
- Aggregator starting before receiving first UC from root chain
- Root chain timeout causing expected round to advance
- Race conditions between UC arrival and round processing
- Stale UC messages arriving after aggregator has moved ahead

### Benefits:
- More reliable synchronization with root chain expectations
- Automatic recovery from timing issues and timeouts
- Clear diagnostics when synchronization adjustments occur
- Prevents aggregator from getting permanently out of sync

This ensures the aggregator maintains synchronization with the root chain even in
challenging scenarios like startup races, heavy load, or network delays.

CHANGELOG ENTRY - 5 July 2025 at 17:45 CET

## BFT Core Analysis - Understanding Repeat UC Handling

### What was analyzed:
- **Examined BFT core implementation** in partition/node.go to understand UC handling
- **Studied repeat UC detection** mechanism and state reversion logic
- **Analyzed T1 timeout handling** for timely block production
- **Documented findings** for improving aggregator's BFT client

### Key discoveries:
1. **Repeat UC detection**:
   - Occurs when root chain times out waiting for certification
   - Identified by same InputRecord but higher root round number
   - Triggers state reversion in BFT core to maintain consistency

2. **T1 timeout mechanism**:
   - Ensures blocks are produced even with few transactions
   - Sends signals to main loop to avoid concurrency issues
   - Prevents indefinite waiting for transactions

3. **Sequential processing**:
   - UC handling must be sequential to prevent race conditions
   - T1 timeout events are queued, not handled directly
   - Critical for maintaining state consistency

### Current aggregator status:
- Already implements deferred finalization (good!)
- Tracks expected rounds and adjusts block numbers
- Missing proper repeat UC detection logic
- Could benefit from T1-like timeout for regular production

### Recommendations documented:
- Implement InputRecord comparison for repeat UC detection
- Enforce sequential UC processing with proper synchronization
- Track both partition rounds and root rounds
- Consider adding timeout-based block production

This analysis provides a roadmap for further improvements to the aggregator's
synchronization with the root chain, based on proven patterns from the BFT core.
